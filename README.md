This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates a potential issue with pointer manipulation. The program modifies a variable through a pointer, resulting in an unexpected value change. This example highlights the importance of understanding how pointers work in C and how to handle them correctly to avoid unintended side effects.  The bugSolution.c file provides a solution.
